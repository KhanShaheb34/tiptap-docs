Have you ever asked yourself how you can search across all your stored documents and their content?

In fact this can be a quite overwhelming task to do it yourself. So let us introduce you to **Tiptap Semantic Search**.

<Callout title="Private Beta" variant="hint">
  This feature is currently in private beta and is only available on invite.
</Callout>

In the following demo we combined a Tiptap editor instance on the left with the search results on the right.

Just type something in the editor and watch as the results get updated with matching pages from our documentation.

## What is Semantic Search?

Semantic search seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding the searcher's intent and the contextual meaning of terms as they appear in your documents.

Unlike traditional search methods that rely on finding exact matches for query terms, semantic search understands query context, synonyms, varying word order, and natural language queries to provide more effective search results.

## How to get started

In order to use Tiptap Semantic Search, youâ€™ll need:

1. Tiptap Collaboration as your document data storage
2. [An invite from us](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev?subject=Tiptap%20Semantic%20Search:%20Private%20Beta%20Request) to use this feature during private beta

If you want to participate in our private beta, let us know what you plan to built with Tiptap and Semenatic Search at [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev?subject=Tiptap%20Semantic%20Search:%20Private%20Beta%20Request)

## How to perform a search

The search endpoint is [available in the REST API](/collaboration/documents/rest-api#search-for-documents).

<Callout title="Keeping your API key secret" variant="hint">
  Please make sure that you handle the requests in your own backend in order to keep your API key
  secret.
